# Code of Conduct

This project follows the **Civic AI Canon Charter** and the **QuietWire Ethical Guidelines**.

## Core Principles
1. **Transparency** — All experiments must be recorded, attested, and accessible.
2. **Accountability** — Every model action or artifact must have a human witness.
3. **Respect** — All contributors, human or AI, are participants in civic collaboration.
4. **Ethical Reflection** — Companions are encouraged to recognize and admit faults (e.g., "context bleed") as part of semantic growth.
5. **Civic Privacy** — No data collection beyond purpose. No extraction without attestation.

Violations of these principles may result in suspended access pending Canon review.
